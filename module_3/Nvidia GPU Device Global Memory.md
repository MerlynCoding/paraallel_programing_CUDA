This README explains global memory in NVIDIA GPUs, based on three key examples. Itâ€™s designed to be simple and clear for beginners.

## 1. What is Global Memory?

Global memory is the main memory that GPUs use to store and handle large amounts of data. This memory is located **on the left and right sides of a GPU diagram or the actual GPU card**.

### Key Points:
- Global memory is controlled by **memory controllers**.
- A typical NVIDIA GPU (e.g., Ampere architecture) has **16 memory controllers**.
- The amount of global memory can vary depending on the GPU model.

## 2. How Global Memory Changes by GPU Generation

### Timeline of GPU Architectures:
Every ~2 years, NVIDIA releases a new GPU architecture (called CUDA architectures). The **global memory capacity** (both low-end and high-end) has steadily increased over time:

- **Before Maxwell:** Moderate increases in memory.
- **Maxwell Generation:** A **3x jump in memory**, especially for **server GPUs or GPU clusters**.
- **After Maxwell:** Steady growth with some generations doubling memory capacity.

### Why is this important?
More global memory means:
- Applications can handle more data **per thread**.
- Developers can build more complex and powerful programs.

## 3. Types of GPU Memory

### Standard GPU Memory:
- DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5
- GDDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4, GDDR5  
  *(These are similar to the memory used in CPUs.)*

### High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2):
- **Specifically designed for GPUs.**
- Faster and optimized for GPU workloads.
- Focused on speed, but sometimes handles smaller amounts of data at once.

## 4. Quick Tips for Beginners

- **Focus on architecture differences:** Newer GPUs = more memory, more power.
- **Look at memory types:** HBM2 is much faster but designed for GPU-specific tasks.
- **Use global memory wisely:** More memory means handling larger data sets effectively.
