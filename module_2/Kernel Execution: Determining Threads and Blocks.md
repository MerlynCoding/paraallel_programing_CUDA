### **Kernel Execution: Determining Threads and Blocks**

In this lecture, we explore the high-level concepts and practical steps to determine the number of threads and blocks for CUDA kernel execution. These decisions depend on the problem’s complexity and data layout (1D, 2D, or 3D). Let's break down the core ideas:

---

### **1. One-Dimensional Thread Layout**

1. **Simplest Layout**:
   - The kernel uses a 1D thread layout.
   - The number of threads per block (`blockDim.x`) and the block index (`blockIdx.x`) determine the thread’s global index.

2. **Example Host Code**:
   ```cpp
   int N = 1618; // Number of elements
   int threadsPerBlock = 32;
   int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

   kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, N);
   ```

3. **Kernel Logic**:
   - Compute the thread’s global index.
   - Ensure the index does not exceed array boundaries:
   ```cpp
   __global__ void kernel(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int N) {
       int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
       if (idx < N) {
           c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];
       }
   }
   ```

### **2. Two-Dimensional Thread Layout**

1. **For Grid-like Problems**:
   - Often used for matrices or image processing tasks.
   - Threads are laid out in a 2D grid, and each thread works on a unique row-column pair.

2. **Example Host Code**:
   ```cpp
   dim3 threadsPerBlock(32, 32); // 32x32 threads per block
   dim3 blocksPerGrid(1, 1);    // Single block in grid

   matrixMul<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, N);
   ```

3. **Kernel Logic**:
   - Compute 2D thread coordinates (`x`, `y`) using thread and block indices:
   ```cpp
   __global__ void matrixMul(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int N) {
       int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
       int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

       if (x < N && y < N) {
           int index = y * N + x;
           c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
       }
   }
   ```

### **3. Three-Dimensional Thread Layout**

1. **For 3D Problems**:
   - Useful for tasks like 3D simulations or volumetric data processing.
   - Threads are laid out in a 3D block.

2. **Example Host Code**:
   ```cpp
   dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16, 16); // 16x16x16 threads per block
   dim3 blocksPerGrid(1, 1, 1);      // Single block in grid

   threeDKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, N);
   ```

3. **Kernel Logic**:
   - Compute the thread’s 3D coordinates and map them to the input data:
   ```cpp
   __global__ void threeDKernel(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int N) {
       int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
       int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
       int z = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;

       if (x < N && y < N && z < N) {
           int index = z * (N * N) + y * N + x;
           c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
       }
   }
   ```

### **4. General Guidelines for Setting Threads and Blocks**

1. **Thread Per Block**:
   - Optimal thread count per block is usually a multiple of 32 (warp size).
   - Typical values: 128, 256, or 512 threads per block.

2. **Blocks Per Grid**:
   - Calculated based on data size and threads per block:
     ```cpp
     blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
     ```

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - Always ensure threads do not exceed the array bounds.

---

### **5. Complex Indexing**
For higher dimensions:
- Add offsets for blocks and threads for `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- Example (3D indexing):
  ```cpp
  int index = (blockIdx.z * gridDim.y + blockIdx.y) * blockDim.x * blockDim.y
              + threadIdx.z * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y * blockDim.x
              + threadIdx.x;
  ```

---

### **6. Summary**
- CUDA kernels support 1D, 2D, and 3D thread layouts.
- The choice depends on the data structure (arrays, matrices, or 3D volumes).
- Ensure proper boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
- Start simple with 1D layouts and gradually scale to 2D or 3D as needed.
